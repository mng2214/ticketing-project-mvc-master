The Ticketing project is a web-based application. It is in the project management domain. It is software as a service (SaaS), and customers pay by subscription.
The main functionality of the application is the administration of tickets in a company. This multiple-role application has administration, manager, and employee sections. We are issuing tickets just like in JIRA, whose name originates from this functionality. 
We built the project in a Spring Web structure (Model-View-Controller). Able to create users from employee to manager. Each employee can be assigned projects and tasks.
